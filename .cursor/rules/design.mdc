To design by contract, define formal, verifiable conditions for software components.

- **Preconditions:** What must be true **before** a function is called (client's responsibility).
- **Postconditions:** What the function guarantees will be true **after** it completes (supplier's responsibility).
- **Invariants:** What must remain true for an object **throughout** its lifecycle.

If a precondition fails, it's a bug in the calling code. This approach makes responsibilities explicit and simplifies debugging.
