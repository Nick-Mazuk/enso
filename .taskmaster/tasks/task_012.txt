# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Client-side Batch Operations (`batch.execute`)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the `client.database.batch.execute()` method for performing non-atomic bulk write operations (e.g., `updateMany`, `replaceMany`, `deleteMany`).
# Details:
This API should allow developers to group multiple write operations into a single request, improving efficiency for scenarios involving many changes. It should handle the internal processing and replication of these bulk changes.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for batch execution logic. Integration tests to verify that bulk operations correctly modify data and are replicated. Performance tests for large batch sizes.
