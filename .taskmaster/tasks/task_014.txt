# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Client-side Preloading (`preload`, `preloadOne`)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the client API with `preload` and `preloadOne` methods for server-side data fetching, aiming to eliminate loading states in UI frameworks.
# Details:
These methods should allow applications to proactively fetch data from the server before it's needed by the UI, enabling seamless transitions and server-side rendering scenarios. This requires coordination with the server-side query engine.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests to verify data is preloaded correctly and available instantly upon UI rendering. Performance tests to measure the impact on initial load times.
