# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Server Sync Protocol Handler & HLC Conflict Resolution
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 5, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the server-side Sync Engine, including the sync protocol handler, multi-tenant coordination, HLC conflict resolution, and change broadcasting.
# Details:
This is the core server component for real-time data synchronization. It needs to receive client changes, apply HLC-based conflict resolution (field-level, last-write-wins), persist changes, and broadcast updates to other connected clients. It must handle multi-tenancy securely.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests simulating multiple clients syncing concurrently, verifying conflict resolution and data consistency. Performance tests for sync throughput. Security tests for tenant isolation.
