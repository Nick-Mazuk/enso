# Task ID: 5
# Title: Establish Client-side WebSocket & HTTP Connection Management
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up robust client-side connection management for WebSocket (real-time updates) and HTTP (bulk operations, initial data loading) for replication.
# Details:
This includes establishing and maintaining connections, handling disconnections, basic reconnection logic, and managing data flow over these protocols. It's the foundation for client-server communication.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for connection establishment, disconnection, and basic reconnection. Integration tests to simulate network interruptions and verify the client's ability to re-establish connections and resume communication.
