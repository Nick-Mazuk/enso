# Task ID: 20
# Title: Develop Framework Integrations (Hooks/Wrappers)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Provide official hooks and wrappers for popular UI frameworks beyond React and Svelte (e.g., Vue, Angular) to simplify integration.
# Details:
This involves creating framework-specific libraries that abstract away the direct Client API calls, providing idiomatic ways to interact with the system (e.g., custom hooks for data fetching, components for real-time updates).

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for each framework-specific wrapper, ensuring correct data flow and reactivity. Develop example applications for each integrated framework. Gather developer feedback.
