# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Client-side Schema Definition (`createSchema`)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the `createSchema` utility for client-only schema definition, enabling type safety and schema evolution through field-level storage and fallbacks.
# Details:
The utility should support defining entities and rooms with specific field types (t.string, t.number, t.boolean, t.date, t.ref, t.refMany). It needs to parse the schema, generate internal type definitions, and provide mechanisms for schema validation during local operations.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for `createSchema` parsing and validation logic. Integration tests to ensure defined schemas correctly influence data type handling and error reporting for invalid data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement `createSchema` Core & Type Parsing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational `createSchema` utility, enabling the definition of entities and rooms. This subtask includes parsing the input schema definition (e.g., `t.string`, `t.number`, `t.ref`) and converting it into a robust internal data structure suitable for type checking and further processing.
### Details:
Define the internal representation for schema types. Implement the parsing logic within `createSchema` to transform user-defined schema objects into this internal format. Ensure support for `t.string`, `t.number`, `t.boolean`, `t.date`, `t.ref`, `t.refMany`.

The internal, optimized Map representation of schema definitions, established by the `createSchema` utility, is now available within the `Schema` object to serve as a strong foundation for efficient validation and type-checking.

<info added on 2025-08-29T03:04:34.497Z>
The schema definition now includes support for `fallback` and `optional` field options, and the internal representation generated by `createSchema` fully encompasses both `entities` and `rooms` structures, which the validation logic must now robustly handle.

## 2. Develop Schema Validation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Implement the core validation engine that uses the internally defined schema to enforce type safety during local data operations (e.g., create, update). This mechanism will ensure that data conforms to the defined types and structures.
### Details:
Design and implement validation functions that can be invoked when data is written or updated. These functions should check field types, required fields, and reference integrity based on the parsed schema.
<info added on 2025-08-29T03:15:38.278Z>
Implemented the `Schema.validate` method for robust runtime validation of objects against the schema. This includes checks for correct field types, required fields, and the proper structure of `ref` and `refMany` reference types, ensuring data integrity. The functionality is fully tested.

## 3. Design & Implement Schema Versioning [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop a mechanism to support schema evolution, including versioning of schemas and handling field-level storage. This allows for backward and forward compatibility as the application's data model changes over time.
### Details:
Define how schema versions will be managed and associated with data. Implement logic to store schema version metadata alongside data or within the schema definition itself. Consider strategies for migrating data between schema versions if necessary.

## 4. Implement Field-Level Fallbacks [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add support for defining and applying field-level fallbacks within the schema. This feature provides default values or alternative logic when a field is missing or invalid, enhancing data robustness and schema evolution.
### Details:
Extend the schema definition to allow specifying fallback values or functions for individual fields. Implement the runtime logic to apply these fallbacks during data retrieval or validation if a field's value is not present or does not conform.

## 5. Document `createSchema` Utility & Examples [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create comprehensive developer documentation for the `createSchema` utility, covering its API, usage patterns, best practices, and detailed examples for defining entities, rooms, and various field types.
### Details:
Write API reference documentation for `createSchema` and its associated type helpers (`t.string`, `t.ref`, etc.). Include examples demonstrating schema definition, validation implications, and how to leverage versioning and fallbacks.
