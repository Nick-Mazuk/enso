# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Server-side Triple Store & Query Engine (SQLite/Turso)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the server-side triple store, designed to be schema-agnostic, and its query engine, utilizing SQLite/Turso for persistence.
# Details:
This involves setting up the database schema for storing triples (subject, predicate, object, HLC timestamp) and developing the server-side query capabilities. It should be optimized for multi-tenant access and efficient data retrieval.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for database schema, data insertion, and basic query operations. Performance tests for data retrieval on large datasets. Integration tests to ensure data consistency and integrity.
