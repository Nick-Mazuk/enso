# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Client-side Reactive Subscriptions
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate reactive subscriptions (`subscribe`, `subscribeOne`) on the client, allowing applications to react to local data changes in real-time.
# Details:
This feature leverages the internal change tracking mechanism of the triple store to notify subscribers when relevant data changes. It should support subscribing to query results and single documents.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for subscription setup and teardown. Integration tests to verify that subscribers receive correct updates when data is created, updated, or deleted locally. Test for filtering and query-specific subscriptions.
