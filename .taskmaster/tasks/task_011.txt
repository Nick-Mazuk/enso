# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Server-side Real-time Rooms (In-memory)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the in-memory server-side component for Real-time Rooms, managing ephemeral pub/sub, per-user session status, and room-wide shared status.
# Details:
This component will handle the logic for joining/leaving rooms, broadcasting events to room members, maintaining user presence, and managing shared room state. It's designed for ephemeral data like cursors or typing indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for room management logic (join, leave, emit). Integration tests with multiple client connections to verify real-time event broadcasting and status updates within rooms. Load tests for concurrent room activity.
