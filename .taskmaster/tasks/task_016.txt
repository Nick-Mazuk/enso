# Task ID: 16
# Title: Integrate Client-side IndexedDB Persistence
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the IndexedDB Adapter for the client-side persistence layer, enabling full offline capability and faster local startup times.
# Details:
This involves replacing or augmenting the in-memory triple store with a persistent IndexedDB backend. Changes should be written to IndexedDB, and data should be loaded from it on startup. This is crucial for robust offline functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests to verify data persistence across browser sessions. Offline tests to ensure full application functionality without network connectivity. Performance tests for IndexedDB read/write operations.
