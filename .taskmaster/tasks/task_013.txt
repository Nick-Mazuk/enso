# Task ID: 13
# Title: Develop Client-side Pagination (`paginated`, `preloadPaginated`)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement efficient pagination capabilities for large datasets on the client, including `.paginated()` and `.preloadPaginated()` methods.
# Details:
This feature allows fetching and displaying data in chunks, optimizing performance and user experience for large result sets. `preloadPaginated` should enable pre-fetching subsequent pages.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for pagination logic (offset, limit, next/previous page). Integration tests to verify correct data retrieval and display across multiple pages. Performance tests for paginated queries.
