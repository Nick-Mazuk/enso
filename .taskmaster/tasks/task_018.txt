# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Authentication & Authorization
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop robust client authentication (e.g., JWT-based) and server-side row-level security, potentially including a management dashboard for App ID generation.
# Details:
This involves securing client-server communication, verifying user identities, and enforcing fine-grained access control to data based on user roles and permissions. The management dashboard would facilitate app and user management.

# Test Strategy:
Security tests for authentication flows (login, token refresh). Integration tests to verify row-level security rules are correctly enforced. Penetration testing for common vulnerabilities.
