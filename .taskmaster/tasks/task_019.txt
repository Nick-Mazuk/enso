# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Storage Optimization (Pruning, Compaction, Caching)
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 9, 16
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop strategies for data pruning, compaction, and advanced caching for both client and server triple stores to optimize storage and performance.
# Details:
This includes mechanisms to remove old or irrelevant data (pruning), consolidate storage (compaction), and implement multi-level caching strategies to reduce database load and improve query response times.

# Test Strategy:
Performance tests measuring storage footprint and query times before/after optimization. Stress tests to verify caching effectiveness under high load. Data integrity tests after pruning/compaction.
