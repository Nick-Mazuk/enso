# Task ID: 17
# Title: Enhance Network Resilience
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 5, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the sync engine's network resilience by implementing advanced connection recovery, partition handling, and automatic reconnection with timestamp-based gap recovery.
# Details:
This task focuses on making the system robust against flaky networks. It includes sophisticated retry mechanisms, detecting and resolving data inconsistencies after network partitions, and ensuring seamless re-synchronization upon reconnection using HLC timestamps.

# Test Strategy:
Stress tests simulating network drops, high latency, and intermittent connectivity. Integration tests to verify automatic reconnection and data consistency after network failures. Concurrency tests during network partitions.
